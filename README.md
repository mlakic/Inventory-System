# Inventory-System
Movie rental store inventory system

Description:
A local movie rental store wishes to automate their inventory tracking system. Currently there are three types of movies/videos (in DVD media) to be tracked:
-	Comedy (denoted as ‘F’ for funny)
-	Drama (denoted as ‘D’)
-	Classics (denoted as ‘C’)
Borrows and returns of items by customers are also to be tracked. Four types of actions are desired in the system:
-	Borrow (denoted as ‘B’): (stock – 1) for each item borrowed  
-	Return (denoted as ‘R’): (stock + 1) for each item returned
-	Inventory (denoted as ‘I’): outputs the inventory of all the items in the store
-	History (denoted as ‘H’): outputs all the transactions of a customer 

You will design and implement a program that will initialize the contents of the inventory from a file (data4movies.txt), the customer list from another file (data4customers.txt), and then process an arbitrary sequence of commands from a third file (data4commands.txt).

Details
In data4movies.txt, the information about each movie is listed as follows: 
-	For comedy movies: F, Stock, Director, Title, Year it released 
-	For drama movies: D, Stock, Director, Title, Year it released
-	For classics movies: C, Stock, Director, Title, Major actor Release date
For example,
F, 10, Nora Ephron, You've Got Mail, 1998
D, 10, Steven Spielberg, Schindler's List, 1993
C, 10, George Cukor, Holiday, Katherine Hepburn 9 1938
C, 10, George Cukor, Holiday, Cary Grant 9 1938
Z, 10, Hal Ashby, Harold and Maude, Ruth Gordon 2 1971
D, 10, Phillippe De Broca, King of Hearts, 1967
Important notes about data4movies.txt:
-	You may assume correct formatting, but codes may be invalid; e.g., in this data, the 'Z' code is an invalid entry so this line has to be discarded and users should be notified about this issue. 
-	While the stock for each line is 10, do not assume that is the case in your design and implementation. 
-	The classical movie type has a different format than the other two. It contains Major actor which is always formatted as two strings, first name and last name, separated by a space. Then the Release date contains month and year information, and no comma (but a space) between Major actor and Release date. In addition, for classical movies, one movie (e.g., Holiday) may have multiple lines so the total stock of this movie will be the sum of all the stocks in the lines about this movie (e.g., 20 for Holiday in the above example). 

To store the data in the system, the items should be sorted as follows:
-	comedy movies (‘F’) sorted by Title, then Year it released 
-	dramas (‘D’) are sorted by Director, then Title 
-	classics (‘C’) are sorted by Release date, then Major actor
You can assume that each item is uniquely identified by its complete set of sorting attributes.  

data4customers.txt contains customer information, one line per customer. Customers have a 4-digit ID number that uniquely identifies them, followed by last name, first name, all separated by a space. For example,
1111 Mouse Mickey
1000 Mouse Minnie
You can also assume that this data is formatted correctly. 

data4commands.txt is used to test your code. The first field is action type (B, R, I, or H). Then the rest of fields are as follows:
-	Action types I: no more fields
-	Action type H: one more field customer ID. Fields are separated by a space
-	Action types B and R: customer ID followed by type of media (currently only ‘D’ for DVD) then movie type and movie data (with values of the two sorting attributes, using comma or space to separate them as in the movie data file). Fields are separated by a space. 
For example,
B 1234 D C 9 1938 Katherine Hepburn
B 1234 D F Pirates of the Caribbean, 2003
R 1234 D C 9 1938 Katherine Hepburn
B 1234 D D Steven Spielberg, Schindler's List,
S
H 1234
X 1234 Z C 9 1938 Katherine Hepburn
B 1234 D Y 2 1971 Ruth Gordon
B 9999 D F Pirates of the Caribbean, 2003
B 1234 D C 2 1975 Blah Blah     

Again, the data will be formatted correctly, but may include errors. 
-	You must handle an invalid action code (e.g., ‘X’ in the above example), invalid video code (e.g., ‘Y’), incorrect customer ID (i.e., not found. For example, 9999), and invalid movie (i.e., not found. For example, classic movie in month 2 of 1975 with a "Blah Blah" title). For bad data, discard the line and notify users.
-	You must also handle incorrect commands. For example, a command that makes the number of an item in the inventory goes below zero, a return command when a movie was not borrowed, etc.



Overall Requirements:    
-	Do not print output for successful ‘B’ or ‘R’ commands, but print error messages for incorrect data and/or incorrect command. Output for ‘H’ and ‘I’ commands should be neatly formatted with one line per item/transaction. ‘I’ should output all Comedy movies, then all Dramas, then all Classics. Each category of movies should be ordered according to the sorting criteria discussed above. ‘H’ should show a list of DVD transactions of a customer in chronological order (latest to earliest) and specify whether the movie was borrowed or returned. 
-	You are required to use at least one hash table in this assignment. There are actually multiple places where they could be used. We will be covering hash tables soon in the class. If you want to get started, the important aspect of hash tables is that they are used for fast lookup of items. For example, if each item can be mapped into a unique number, you can use an array to store the items according to their unique number and look them up in O(1) time. Hash tables usually waste some memory, since not all of the array will be filled. However, the waste is not too bad, if you store pointers to items, rather than the items themselves.
-	You are required to use inheritance. If you find you’re using templates a lot, run it by me, as this assignment is designed for you to practice using inheritance. 
-	There are no other specific requirements for this assignment, but as always it should be well designed (not violate the basic design principles – will be discussed in class), easily extensible, efficiently coded, well documented, etc.
